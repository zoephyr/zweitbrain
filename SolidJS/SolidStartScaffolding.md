# Creating a basic R2 Uploader
These notes will hopefully get fleshed out more in the relevant repo and linked appropriately.

The `solid-start-scaf` project is intended to provide a lightweight "scaffold" over certain opionated abstractions to get started with creating Solid JS applications quickly.

This lightweight CMS is built to be used with an S3 compatible storage, REDIS service (self-hosted, or a service like Upstash) and SQL (again, pick your flavor and adapter). The project will install a template where you drop in your credentials and get up and running with building a Solid App that's connected to a KV store/cache through Redis, 



# Addtl. Notes
Using Solid Start v0.5.9, and AWS SDK 3.521.0 (these version pins were important for a reason I forgot, but just make sure that the Presign URL and S3-client packages are lock stepped)
